# Bank Transaction Manager
# Overview
This project is a React application developed by me,Patrick Maina,as part of a code challenge. The application aims to display a list of recent bank transactions and offers features such as adding new transactions and filtering transactions by description.

# Instructions
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/Nju9una/bank-transaction-manager.git.
Navigate to the project directory using cd bank-transaction-manager.
Install the dependencies by running npm install or yarn install.
Start the development server with npm start or yarn start.
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
# Features
# Core Deliverables
Table of Transactions: Users can view a table displaying their recent bank transactions.
Add New Transaction: Users can fill out and submit a form to add a new transaction. The newly added transaction will be displayed in the table. Note that no persistence mechanism is implemented for this feature.
Filter Transactions: Users can filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with descriptions matching the search term will be shown in the transactions table.
# Additional Notes
I added 3 example transactions just to show how it horks and what is outputs basically.
